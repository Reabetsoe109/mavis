# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Python + Streamlit)

This small project visualizes sorting algorithms using Python and Streamlit. It helps to compare algorithm behavior (swaps, comparisons) and efficiency visually.

Features
- Visual animations for Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort
- Controls for algorithm selection, array size, speed, randomization, and stepping

Getting started

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app with Streamlit:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Notes
- Use smaller arrays for smoother animation.
- This demo focuses on educational visualization rather than performance benchmarking.

Extensions you can add
- Add more algorithms (Heap, Shell, TimSort)
- Show counters for comparisons and swaps
- Add step backward or playback controls
